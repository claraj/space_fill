Imagine the flat world of Tkinterland is home to little rainbow blobs. They've all to share in the work of travelling all around the world, from their houses, to make sure everything is in order. Their houses have been conveniently set up so the busiest parts of the world have more blobs. What parts of the world should each cover?  This hacky little program has a go at figuring out a section for each blob.

TODO Someone has almost certainly solved this properly. Some research into a correct-er solution would be recommended instead of using this version :)
